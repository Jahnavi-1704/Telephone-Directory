# Telephone-Directory

Desciption-

- This program is a phone directory which provides several services to store and retrieve phone numbers from the North American region and the caller name associated to each one of them using the Hash table abstract data structure.

- In order to resolve collisions in hash table, 2 separate collision resolution techniques have been implemented through 2 separate classes-

(i) Open Addressing through Double Hashing

(ii) Separate Chaining

- Both the classes can initialize/create a hash table, insert a phone number in the the hash table, search for a phone number and display it and delete a phone number entry from the table.

- All the functions take place in a constant time of 1 clock cycle of any computer O(1). This has been acheived by using a status vector to keep track of each position of the hash table.

- Both the primary and secondary hash functions use the Division Method

This program involves-

-> OOP Principles- Data abstraction and encapsulation (through use of classes), modularity

-> Dynamic Memory Allocation- pointers

-> STL Container classes- Arrays, Vectors

-> C++ Libraries- String, vector, math

-> Flow of control

-> Iterators, Functions
